# Alternative HTML to PDF

This example describes alternative to `rpaframework` for creating PDF from HTML content.

The `pdfkit` package is a wrapper for `wkhtmltopdf` binary, which needs to be installed on the worker machine separately.

Eventually `wkhtmltopdf` will be available in the Robocorp Cloud Worker.
